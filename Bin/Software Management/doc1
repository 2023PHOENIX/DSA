q1 :  Evolutionary Development, Spiral and RAD software life cycle model based on characteristics of requirements.

Answer 1 : 

	we are going to compare model on the basic of 
	1. Correctness
	2. Completeness
	3. Consistency
	4. Unambiguosness
	5. Ranking of importance and stabilty
	6. Modifiability
	7. Verifiablity
	8. Traceabilty
	9. Design dependency
	10. Testability 
	11. Underestandable by customer
	12. Right level of abstraction


	1. WaterFall Model : 
		It is easy to use and used in small projects. 
		It require planning in early stage.
		Detailed documents are required. 
		Maintenace is least.
		Felixiblity to change is very difficult.
		User involement is least only required in the begining of project
		Testing is possible afer completion of coding phase.
		Design dependency is very high.
		Re-usabllity is very low.
		Time frame is very high.
		Cost is low as compare to other models.
		Hard for customer to understand in begining.
		It not useable in real life projects
	2. Iterative Enhancement Model:
		This model is same as Waterfall model but with some restriction. Genera	lly
