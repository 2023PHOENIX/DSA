The Rules of COmmunications Fundamentals:
	there are threee elements of any communication :
		1. There will be a source.
		2. There will be a destination.
		3. There will ne a channl that provide for the path of communicatin to occur.

All communication are governed by protocols.


The Rules of Network Protocol Requirement
	common computer protocols must be in agreement include the following requirements:
		1. Messege encoding 
		2. Message formatting and encapsulation
		3. Message size
		3. Message delivery Options.

1. Messege Encoding : 
	Encoding is the process of converting information into another acceptable transmission.
	Decoding is process to convert acceptable transmission to information that is readable by user.

2. Messege Formatting :
	If some message is sent it must be use a specific formate or structure.
	Message format depend on the type of message and the channel that deliver the messege.

3. Message Size : 
	Message sent across the network are converted to bits.
	The bits are encoded into pattern of light,sound,or electrical impulses.
	The reciver host must decode the signals to intercept the message.

4. Messege Timming : 
	Flow Control : manage the rate of data transmission and defines how much information can be sent and the speed at which it can be delivered.

	Respone timeout : Manages how long a device waits when it does not a hear a reply from the destination.

5. Messege Delivery Options 
	Unicast : one to one communication.

	Multicast : One to many.

	BroadCast : One to all.



Network Protocols define a common set of rules 
	-> Can be implemented on devices in : 
		. software
		. Hardware
		. Both
	-> Protocols have their own
		. Function
		. Format
		. Rules

Protocol InterAction : 
	Network require to use of several protocol.
		like HTTP,TCD,IP,Ethernet.


Protocol suites :
	Able to work with other protocols.

	protocol suite : 
		1. A group of inter-related protocols necessary to perform a communication function
		2. Set of rules that work to help solve a problem.



	In term of Layer : 
		Higher Layer.
		Lower Layer

		Some of the protocol suites 
		1. Internet Protocol Suite(TCP/IP)
		2. Open System  Interconnection (OSI)
		3. Novell NetWare
